3.
Fill the _parameters directories with parameter files
they must be named parameters_X.par where X is the number of basisfunctions they are for
Also put packed folder containing the mesh files there. Currently the Folder must be called
mesh_X and be packed as mesh_X.tar.gz where X is the Name for the Benchmark
Currently valid values are: LOH1Scaling, TetraElastic, TetraLOH4
Fill _reference directories according to README files

4. 
either you set your git path in the transformationCatalogue to let git pull the trunk during
the workflow.
Or you generate the your workflow with 'git=no'. Then you need to create a folder trunk, 
containing the SeisSol trunk, pack it to trunk.tar.gz and place it in the input folder
